Our 2nd Maptime Boston of the year. Come learn about the powerful Javascript library D3 (http://d3js.org/) and its map- and geo-related features.

**Update:**

The talk slides are here: [http://maptimeboston.github.io/d3-maptime/](http://maptimeboston.github.io/d3-maptime). And do follow some of the additional links within if you're trying to learn D3; there are a lot of great resources out there.

If you know other good resources or any cool maps that you've made or seen, please share!

**Beginners are encouraged, and be sure bring your laptop.**
