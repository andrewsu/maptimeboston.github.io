title: March Maptime - Spatial Data Formats and Data Sources
rsvp: http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-Boston/events/220960923/
---

For our March Maptime, Shaun Walbridge is going to talk all about [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org), [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/wiki), [Shapefiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) and your other favorite spatial data formats.

*Update:* The spatial data formats talk is up at [https://4326.us/maptime-data-formats](https://4326.us/maptime-data-formats), with a [full repository](https://github.com/scw/maptime-data-formats-2015) up on Github. We also had a few additional tools and formats come up in the discussion:

 - [csvkit](https://csvkit.readthedocs.org/) for slicing, dicing, and even joining CSV files (suggested by Sean Sweeney)
 - [pygeobuf](https://github.com/mapbox/pygeobuf), a protobuf based format for encoding GeoJSON-like streams.

CartoDB is sponsoring Maptime this month and will be buying pizza for us!
