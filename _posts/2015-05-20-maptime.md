title: May Maptime - Mapbox Studio and CartoCSS
---

For our May Maptime, we worked with [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/), a powerful tool for designing global basemaps driven by vector tiles. Mapbox Studio allows you to style maps using a world of OpenStreetMap data provided, or use your own data. We went through the basics of the software, the CartoCSS styling language, and how to share maps.

We followed [Mapbox Guides](https://www.mapbox.com/guides/) for much of this:
