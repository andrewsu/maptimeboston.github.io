title: June Maptime - Show and Tell (and our first birthday!)
rsvp: http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-Boston/events/223117741/

It's #maptimeBoston's first birthday so let's do a show-and-tell night! Bring your projects at whatever stage (finished, in-progress, unformed idea) to share with the group and get friendly, supportive feedback.

Whether for fun or for work, your first map or your 1000th, we’d love to see what you’ve been up to! As always, beginners are very welcome and especially encouraged to show anything they've learned at Maptime.

If you just want to come to see what others are doing or you're looking for inspiration, show up!

Anyone planning to show something will have about 5 minutes or less.
