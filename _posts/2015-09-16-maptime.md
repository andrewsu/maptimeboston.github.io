For our September Maptime, Kent Johnson gave us an introduction to mapping with [R](https://www.r-project.org/), from working with geospatial data to creating a simple Leaflet map. The data, project, and presentation materials are on [Kent's GitHub account](https://github.com/kent37/Maptime-Mapping-with-R).
