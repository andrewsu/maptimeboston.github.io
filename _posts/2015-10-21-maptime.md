To mark a new school year, Andy and Mike revisited the [Web Maps 101 presentation](http://maptimeboston.github.io/web-maps-101/#0) from all the way back at our very first meetup, with a few updates. Andy covered some basic concepts of web maps, and Mike provided some tips and tools for finding geographic data and making maps.
